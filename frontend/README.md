# Setup

- Install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (drop-in replacement for nvm that's significantly faster - highly recommended) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- run `fnm use` (or `nvm use`) to make sure your computer uses the most recent node version
- install yarn
- download and place the frontend `.env.development` file in the root of the frontend folder
- run `yarn`
- run `yarn start`
