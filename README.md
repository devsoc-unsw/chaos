I have created the booking page using Shadcn and Tailwind. There is 1 noticeable issue with Shadcn is I could not install Shadcn component by using its command - it does not create anything. Instead I have to create a component file manually and copy and paste that code in, also install the right npm packages for that. I don't know why tho. 
Here's YouTube link of the booking page demo: https://youtu.be/F9voDsuoXlc
